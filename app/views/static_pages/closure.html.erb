<h1>Fun with Closures</h1>


<p>This counter uses a global variable to keep track of the current number.</p>
<p>It appears to work well. Try it and see...</p>

<%= button_tag "Count!", :class => "btn btn-primary", :type => "button", :id => "count", :size => "166x66" %>

<p id="demo">0</p>

<p>There is a problem with using a global variable however.
  The problem is that any script on the page can change the global count variable.</p>
  <p>See what happens when the wrong script affects the counter...</p>

  <%= button_tag "Change Count!", :class => "btn btn-primary", :type => "button", :id => "change_count", :size => "166x66" %>

  <p>Since JavaScript does not include private properties closures must be used.</p>
  <p>A closure is when there is a function within a function.
    The inner function has access to the outer function's variables.
    However there are no other functions have access to these variables.</p>

    <p>This counter uses a closure which simulates a private variable</p>

    <%= button_tag "Count with Closure!", :class => "btn btn-primary", :type => "button", :id => "count_closure", :size => "166x66" %>

    <p id="closureAdd">0</p>

    <p>This doubling counter also uses a closure which simulates a private variable</p>

    <%= button_tag "Double with Closure!", :class => "btn btn-primary", :type => "button", :id => "double_closure", :size => "166x66" %>

    <p id="closureDouble">1</p>
