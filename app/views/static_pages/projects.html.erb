<%= link_to "Superhero Secrets", posts_path %>
<p>I built this using the Devise Gem for the Authorization and Authentication features.<br>

<br>
<%= link_to "Real Time Calculator", calculators_index_path %>

  I used AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) to
  allow the calculations to occur and be displayed without having to reload the page.

</p>


<br>
<%= link_to "Spinning Wheel", spinning_wheel_path %>
<p>I'm not exactly sure what I built or why I built this :) In any event,
  the image rotates and pauses rotation when you press the Start/Pause button.
  The JQuery Rotate library was used for this effect.
</p>




<br>
<%= link_to "Tip Calculator", tip_calculator_path %>
<p>This is a simple tip calculator that uses JavaScript to perform the calculation.
  There are validations to ensure that the only positive numbers are accepted.

<%= link_to "Mystery Movie", mystery_movie_path %>
<p>Can you guess what the mystery movie is? <br>

<br>
<%= link_to "Sticky Notes", tasks_path %>
<p>These are like Post It Notes, but you don't have to worry about them falling off.
  This was built with Ruby on Rails and lots of CSS Styling, plus a personalized (aka horrible) button design by myself.
</p>

<br>
<%= link_to "Action Cats", cats_path %>
<p>Since cats own the internet, I let them take over one of my pages.
  These are JQuery rotations and animations and many event handlers.
</p>



<br>
<%= link_to "Weather Now", weather_path %>
<p>Enter a city and find out its current temperature. This was made using the
  <%= link_to "Open Weather Map API", "http://openweathermap.org/api" %> which

</p>

<br>
<%= link_to "Random Quote Generator", random_quote_path %>
<p>This idea came from Free Code Camp's <%= link_to "Random Quote Generator", "http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/zipline-build-a-random-quote-machine" %>.
  I have added a random image in addition to the random quote. Furthermore, neither the same image nor the same quote will appear twice in a row.
</p>

<br>
<%= link_to "Design a Webpage", "http://www.bryanttunbutr.com/webdev.html" %>
<p>This idea came from Codecademy's <%= link_to "Website Project", "https://www.codecademy.com/courses/html-css-prj" %>.

  however, I am more than happy to return to using Twitter Bootstrap and Sass.

This site shows how a project can unify physics, JQuery, HTML animation, mouse listeners, and much more.
</p>

<br>
<%= link_to "Meditation Timer", meditation_path %>
<p>This site used the <%= link_to "Pomodoro Timer", countdown_path %>

</p>
