<br>
<%= link_to "Real Time Calculator", calculators_index_path %>
<p>This calculator performs operations in real-time.
  I used AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) to
  allow the calculations to occur and be displayed without having to reload the page.

</p>


<br>
<%= link_to "Spinning Wheel", spinning_wheel_path %>
<p>I'm not exactly sure what I built or why I built this :) In any event,
  the image rotates and pauses rotation when you press the Start/Pause button.
  The JQuery Rotate library was used for this effect.
</p>




<br>
<%= link_to "Tip Calculator", tip_calculator_path %>
<p>This is a simple tip calculator that uses JavaScript to perform the calculation.
  There are validations to ensure that the only positive numbers are accepted.

<<<<<<< HEAD
<%= link_to "Sticky Notes", tasks_path %>
<p>These are like Post It Notes, but you don't have to worry about them falling off.
  This was built with Ruby on Rails and lots of CSS Styling, plus a personalized (aka horrible) button design by myself.
</p>

<br>
<%= link_to "Action Cats", cats_path %>
<p>Since cats own the internet, I let them take over one of my pages.
  These are JQuery rotations and animations and many event handlers.
