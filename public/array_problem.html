    <h1>Array Interview Question</h1>
    <br>
    <p>A few weeks ago I had this interview question (via Google Hangouts).
      I thought I would share here what I did well as well as the mistakes I made.
      Hopefully others can learn from both :)</p>

      <p>The challenge was to find the largest number and index in this array</p>
      <p>
        <code>[1,2,10,3,4]</code>
      </p>

      <p>I immediately panicked because I didn't even know there was supposed to be a coding problem.
        I also started mumbling about being rusty with my data structures and algorithms.
        I wasted 2 minutes by starting to code a bubble sort and its nested loop.
      </p>

      <p>I finally caught myself and asked, "Wait, do I need to sort this array? What is the exact output?"
      </p>


      <p>The interviewer typed out
        <em>
          Largest number: 10, Index: 2
        </em>
      </p>

      <p>The reason I wasted 2 minutes was because I made the mistake of not clarifying the question at the very beginning.
      </p>
      <p>I had forgotten what I was taught by a college professor about solving these types of problems.
        He had taught me to draw a table with the headers Input and Output, and then write out what the problem is specifcally asking for before even starting to solve the challenge.
        In this case it would have been...
      </p>
      <table class="table">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Input</th>
            <th>Output</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><code>[1,2,10,3,4]</code></td>
            <td>Largest number: 10, Index: 2</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>


        <p>The great news is that after I knew the exact problem, I was able to quickly solve the problem in 2 minutes. Check out working the code below.
        </p>

        <pre>
          //array of numbers, find the largest number,
          //find the largest number's index
          var nums = [1,2,10,3,4];

          //set largest index to the first array item
          var largestIndex=0;

          //set largest number to the first array item
          var largestNum=nums[0];

          //loop through every element in the array except the first element
          for(var i=1;i< nums.length;i++){

            //if the current element is larger than the largest number
            if(nums[i]>largestNum){

              //set this current number to be the largest number
              largestNum=nums[i];

              //set the current index to be the largest index
              largestIndex=i;
            }
          }

          //print out results
          console.log(largestNum);
          console.log(largestIndex);

        </pre>

        <p>My work was not completely finished, however, because I was given an additional challenge.
          The previous array was modified.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>[1,2,10,3,10]</code>
        </p>


        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
